# Introduction

Learn Data Structure using Java 8+

## 1. Data Structures Must Know :

- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly)
- Stacks & Queues
- Hash Maps / Hash Tables
- Binary Trees & Binary Search Trees (BST)
- Graphs (BFS, DFS, Adjacency Lists/Matrices)
- Heaps / Priority Queues
- Tries (Prefix Trees)
- Balanced Trees (AVL, Red-Black Trees)
- Suffix Trees / Arrays
- Graphs Algorithms (Shortest Path, Minimum Spanning Tree)
- Advanced Sorting Algorithms (Merge, Quick, Heap Sort)
- Disjoint Set / Union-Find

## 2. Data Structures Good to Know for TOP Companies:
   
- Segment Trees & Fenwick Trees
- Interval Trees
- B-Trees & B+ Trees
- Skip Lists
- Bloom Filters
- K-D Trees (for spatial data)
- Suffix Automaton
- Ternary Search Trees
- Sparse Tables
- Treaps
- Circular Buffers

  
## 3. Data Structures Good to Know for Tier-1 Companies:

- Arrays & Strings (with advanced problem-solving)
- Dynamic Arrays (Vectors in C++, ArrayLists in Java)
- Hash Maps & Sets (for efficient lookups)
- Graphs (Advanced Algorithms: Dijkstraâ€™s, A*, Floyd-Warshall)
- Heaps / Priority Queues (Min/Max)
- Tries (For autocomplete, dictionary problems)
- Dynamic Programming Optimizations (Memoization with DS)
- Balanced Trees (AVL, Red-Black Trees)
- Disjoint Set / Union-Find (with path compression)
- Suffix Arrays & Trees (for pattern matching problems)
- Advanced Linked Lists (Skip Lists, XOR Linked Lists)
