## 🛠 How to Use
- Navigate to the language of choice (java/, python/, javascript/, typescript/).
- Each folder contains topic-wise implementations (arrays, trees, graphs, etc.).
- Code is written to be interview-ready:
- Clean, readable, well-documented.
- Includes time & space complexity.
- Examples/test cases where relevant.

## 🎯 Why This Repo?
- Covers must-know, good-to-know, and advanced topics in a structured way.
